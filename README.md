## Implementation of algorithms and modelling techniques discussed in *Kay Giesecke, Baeho Kim, Shilin Zhu, (2011) Monte Carlo Algorithms for Default Timing Problems. Management Science 57(12):2115-2129.* https://doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.1110.1411

## Under the guidance of Prof Shashi Jain (Dept of Management Sciences, IISc) and Prof S.K. Iyer (Dept. of Mathematics, IISc). In collaboration with Devang Sinha (IITG, FSID-IISc)

To run the current (naive and unoptimised, potentially even inaccruate) implementation of exact A/R (algorithm 3.1 from the paper) sampling scheme for the top down model (section 4 of the paper), clone the repository, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. Then navigate to ```exact_ar_3.1```, as the root and run ```python top_down/main.py```
